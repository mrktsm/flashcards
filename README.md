# Web Development Project 3 - *Flashcards*

Submitted by: **Marko Tsymbaliuk**

This web app: **Flashcards is an interactive learning app built with React. It allows users to view and interact with flashcards, displaying one side of the card at a time, revealing the second side upon clicking, and offering random card navigation. The goal of this project was to practice and understand React fundamentals, including state management, event handling, and component rendering.**

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total

- State Management: Managing state for card visibility and ensuring everything updated correctly was a challenge but a good learning experience.
